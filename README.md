üêæ Animal Simulation (JavaFX)
A JavaFX-based simulation inspired by Conway‚Äôs Game of Life, where animals live, die, and reproduce based on simple rules. 
Each tick updates the grid according to neighboring animals, creating emergent patterns of life. Perfect for experimenting with basic artificial life and cellular automata concepts.


This simulation runs on a grid where each cell can either be empty or contain an animal. Animals follow a set of rules each "tick" (simulation step):

Survival: Different species of animals co-exist in the same ecosystem.

Death: An animal dies from hunger, or is eaten by another predator.

Birth: A male and a female of the same species are able to give birth, on a random chance, with a random litter size. The genes of the parent animals are passed down onto the offspring, enabling for mutations.

Optionally, animals may move, age, or have different actions like hunting in groups.
